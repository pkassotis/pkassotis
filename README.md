### There is no greater thrill in life than running an app successfully with no errors. ðŸ§ 

I started out as a self-taught programmer but eventually went to school to study CS and Software Development when I decided building websites was not enough for me. I've created my own [cryptocurrency](https://github.com/pkassotis/Vedra), [several Python programs](https://github.com/pkassotis?tab=projects), and Iâ€™m particularly interested in machine learning (I'd like to one day build a [digital replica of myself](https://github.com/pkassotis/DigitalMe) and live forever online). Iâ€™m a [Developer Program Member](https://developer.github.com/program), the project manager behind [GitHub FOSS](https://github.com/GitHub-FOSS) and the captain of [GitHub's Jolly Rogers](https://github.com/github-jolly-rogers). So far Iâ€™ve worked as a consultant and product engineer for [Mozilla](https://community.mozilla.org/en/people/pkassotis/), [Rakuten](https://github.com/pkassotis/kassotis.com), [Fiverr](https://github.com/pkassotis/marketplace.chaobear.com) (the company itself not its gigs), and I'm also an [IT recruiter for Hunt Club](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bearofleipzig/), referring talented coders to tech companies all over the world. You'll either find me coding and animating or [representing ICANN and the Internet Society](https://atlarge.icann.org/individual-members/euralo) in various governmental forums and annual gatherings. According to [Clarke's Third Law](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305678.001.0001/acref-9780195305678-e-70) any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic and I intent on casting many spells here on GitHub.
