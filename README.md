### There is no greater thrill in life than running an app successfully with no errors. ðŸ§ 

I started out as a self-taught programmer but eventually went to school to study CS when I decided ordinary web development was not enough for me. Iâ€™m currently working my way towards Python mastery and Iâ€™m particularly interested in machine learning. Iâ€™m a [Development Program Member](https://developer.github.com/program) and the project manager behind [GitHub FOSS](https://github.com/GitHub-FOSS). So far Iâ€™ve worked as a consultant and product engineer for [Google](https://referworkspace.app.goo.gl/Qiuo), [Rakuten](https://github.com/pkassotis/kassotis.com), [Fiverr](https://github.com/pkassotis/marketplace.chaobear.com) (the company itself not its gigs) and [ESPN](https://github.com/pkassotis/vonleipzig.com).
